### Discussion Questions & Sample Answers


**Q1: When was the last time you stayed at a hotel?**

* **Positive:** *Actually*, I stayed at a lovely boutique hotel last month. To be honest, it was a very relaxing experience because the service was exceptional.
* **Neutral:** I stayed in a hotel about six months ago during a business trip. It was quite a standard stay, though I would have preferred a room further from the elevator.

**Q2: Do you like to stay at hotels?**

* **Positive:** Yes, I definitely do! I find it very convenient, especially when breakfast is included. It’s a nice break from daily chores.
* **Negative:** *To be honest*, I’m afraid I prefer staying in apartments. I find hotels a bit too formal, and I like having my own kitchen.

**Q3: What are some things you look for in a hotel room? (AC vs Fan / Breakfast)**

* **Opinion 1:** I personally prefer air conditioning because it’s much more effective in hot weather. Also, having breakfast included is quite important to me as it saves a lot of time in the morning.
* **Opinion 2:** *Actually*, I don't mind a fan if the weather is mild. However, I could say that a stable Wi-Fi connection is more vital for me than a fancy breakfast.
