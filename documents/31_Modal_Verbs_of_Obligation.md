## 2. Grammar Essentials

### **Must vs Have to (Affirmative)**

**Must:** Used when the obligation comes from the **speaker's feelings** or personal opinion.

* *Formula:* `Subject + must + Verb (infinitive without 'to')`
* *Example:* I **must** write to Ann. I haven't written to her for ages.
 
**Have to:** Used for **facts** and external obligations (rules, laws, work requirements).

* *Formula:* `Subject + have to/has to + Verb (infinitive)`
 
*Example:* She **has to** wear glasses for reading.

### **Tenses and Forms**
 
**Present/Future:** Both *must* and *have to* can be used.
 
**Past:** Only **had to** is used (*musted* does not exist).
 
**Future:** **Will have to** is the standard form.

### **Negative Forms (The Big Difference)**

**Mustn’t (Must not):** It is **forbidden** or necessary NOT to do something.

* *Example:* You **mustn't** park here. It's against the rules.
 
**Don’t / Doesn’t have to:** It is **not necessary** (there is no need).
 
*Example:* I **don't have to** wear a suit to work, but I usually do.
