### 2. Grammar Essentials

#### **The Core Rule**

We use the **Present Perfect** to describe actions that started in the past and continue up to the present moment. 

**Sentence Structure** 

* **Affirmative:** Subject + **have / has** + **Verb (V3/ed)**

*Example: I have studied English for 15 years.* 


* **Negative:** Subject + **haven't / hasn't** + **Verb (V3/ed)**
 
*Example: She hasn't lived in England since 2015.* 


* **Question:** **(How long) + have / has** + Subject + **Verb (V3/ed)?**

*Example: How long have you studied French?* 





#### **Since vs. For**


**Since** + a specific point in time (e.g., 2012, Monday, childhood). 

 
**For** + a period of time (e.g., 5 years, a long time, two months). 


**Been to vs. Been in** 

* **Been to:** Used when you visited a place and returned. (*I've been to Paris twice.*) 


* **Been in:** Used when you are still in that place or talking about duration inside it. (*I've been in London for three years — I live here.*)
